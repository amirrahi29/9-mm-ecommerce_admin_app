## Getting Started

This project is based on ecommerce (medicine selling) application by flutter and firebase firestore. In this project you will get whole things like search, filter, order tracking etc. after order placed. I have created this by MVVM architecture with Razorpay payment and GetX State management.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
